# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r DataForTable2_1-table, echo = FALSE}

DataForTable2_1 %>%
  select(country_name, year, life_ladder, healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth, social_support) %>%
  filter(year == "2011" & healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth != "NA" & social_support != "NA") %>%
  summarise(
            min_happiness = min(life_ladder),
            max_happiness = max(life_ladder),
            avg_happiness = mean(life_ladder),
            min_life_expectancy = min(healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth),
            max_life_expectancy = max(healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth),
            avg_life_expectancy = mean(healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth),
            min_social_support = min(social_support),
            max_social_support = max(social_support),
            avg_social_support = mean(social_support))

DataForTable2_1 %>%
  select(country_name, year, life_ladder, healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth, social_support) %>%
  filter(year == "2021" & healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth != "NA" & social_support != "NA") %>%
  summarise(
            min_happiness = min(life_ladder),
            max_happiness = max(life_ladder),
            avg_happiness = mean(life_ladder),
            min_life_expectancy = min(healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth),
            max_life_expectancy = max(healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth),
            avg_life_expectancy = mean(healthy_life_expectancy_at_birth),
            min_social_support = min(social_support),
            max_social_support = max(social_support),
            avg_social_support = mean(social_support))

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
